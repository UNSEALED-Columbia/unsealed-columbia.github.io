			<p>The purpose of unSEAled is to provide a space to share Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American experiences through writing, art, music, film, and photography. This project is being created in collaboration between numerous organizations on campus, including but not limited to the Vietnamese Students Association, Liga Filipina, the Malaysian Students Association, and the Singapore Students Asscociation.
		    <br><br>
		  The unSEAled zine will consist of both student submissions and curated selections of prominent Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American artists. There will both a print and online version. There is no requirement on what type of works are submitted, as long as you are Southeast Asian or Southeast Asian American. We ultimately hope to elevate Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American voices while bringing together and showcasing our diverse communities.
		  <br><br>
		      <p>During the month of October and November, we'll gradually share various student submissions (as permitted by the artist), curated selections, interviews, and blog posts on this website. Stay tuned for more and follow us on Facebook!</p>
