			<p>The purpose of unSEAled is to provide a space to share Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American experiences through writing, art, music, film, and photography. This project is being created in collaboration between numerous organizations on campus, including but not limited to the Vietnamese Students Association, Liga Filipina, the Malaysian Students Association, the Thai Club, and the Singapore Students Asscociation.
		    <br><br>
		  The unSEAled zine will consist of both student submissions and curated selections of prominent Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American artists. There will both a print and online version. There is no requirement on what type of works are submitted, as long as you are Southeast Asian or Southeast Asian American. We ultimately hope to elevate Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American voices while bringing together and showcasing our diverse communities.
		  <br><br>
		      <p>During the month of October and November, we'll gradually share previews of various submissions (as permitted by the artist) on this website. Stay tuned for more and follow us on Facebook!</p>

		  <h2><strong>Any work of art, writing, music, film, or photography can be submitted to the unSEAled Zine!</strong></h2>
		  <br>
		    <p> It does not have to relate directly to the Southeast Asian or Southeast Asian American identity. Art takes all forms, and every voice and perspective is appreciated. The only requirement is that you, the submitter, are Southeast Asian or Southeast Asian American identifying. <b>(You do not have to be a student at Columbia University to submit.)</b>
		  <br><br>
		  <p>There will be two different versions of the unSEAled zine: a print version and an online version. The print version will be limited to art, writing, and photography. The online version will also feature music and film. During the months of October and November, we will gradually add previews and submissions to this website leading up to the launch. As the artist, you can tell us whether or not you want this to occur with your piece in your submission form!</p>
		  <br><br>
		    <p>All writing pieces will be reviewed by an editorial board who will work with you to finetune whatever you submit.</p>
